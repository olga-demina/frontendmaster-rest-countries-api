## My process
Firstly I build the base layout without styles.
I implemented searchfield and select to filter the list of countries.
Them I included react router to implement navigation between pages.
After this I added the styles with tailwind and in the end I implemented dark mode switcher.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React hooks
- [Tailewind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a utility-first CSS framework 


### What I learned

Thi is my very first self build project in react. Here I used Tailwind for the first time.
